# SmartSolarPannel
Project that won 1st Price in IEEE hackathon

Overview:
This project was designed to address common challenges faced by solar panels in India, such as overheating, inconsistent sunlight exposure, and dust accumulation, which significantly reduce their efficiency.

Key Features:

1. Automated Sun Tracking:
Implemented a dynamic tracking system using a microcontroller programmed with time zone data and real-time sun positioning through Google Weather. This allows the panel to adjust its angle to ensure the sun's rays hit its surface at 90 degrees throughout the day, maximizing energy generation.

2. Liquid Cooling System:
To tackle the issue of overheating, I integrated a liquid cooling system similar to those used in modern CPU cooling. This technology helps maintain optimal operating temperatures, thereby enhancing the panelâ€™s performance and longevity.

3. Self-Cleaning Mechanism:
Dust accumulation is a major factor reducing solar panel efficiency. I developed a self-cleaning system that can be activated via a smartphone, allowing for remote and convenient cleaning as needed, typically once a week.

Impact:
The Smart Solar Panel project significantly improves energy output, reduces maintenance requirements, and ensures consistent performance under various environmental conditions. This innovation has the potential to make solar energy a more reliable and efficient resource in regions with challenging climates.
